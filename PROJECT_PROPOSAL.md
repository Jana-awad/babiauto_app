# Project Proposal

**Project Title:** BabiAuto – Car Rental Mobile Application

## Introduction

BabiAuto is a cross-platform mobile application designed to simplify the car rental experience by enabling users to browse, book, and manage rental vehicles seamlessly. The app is powered by a Laravel-based backend REST API and provides a smooth and modern user interface for Android and iOS devices.

This project will be developed as part of a two-month internship program focused on **mobile development** using **Flutter**. The goal is to deliver a functional and user-friendly mobile solution that integrates with backend APIs, incorporates modern mobile app practices, and ensures a reliable experience for end-users.

## Target Platforms

- **Android** (primary target for wide adoption)
- **iOS** (secondary target for Apple users)

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication**

   - Registration and login with form validation and error handling
   - Secure session management using Token-based authentication

2. **Vehicle Management**

   - Browse available cars with details (price, model, images)
   - Book or reserve cars in real-time

3. **Booking & Payments**

   - View booking history and details
   - Integration with payment APIs (future scope)

4. **Offline Capability**

   - Local storage for essential features (cached vehicles, user data)
   - Smooth experience when network is unavailable

5. **Push Notifications**

   - Real-time updates for booking confirmations, reminders, and offers
   - Firebase or OneSignal integration

6. **User Profile & Settings**

   - Manage personal details, preferences, and rental history
   - Secure logout

## Internship Tasks & Deliverables

1. **UI/UX Design** – Create wireframes and mockups for major screens (login, vehicle list, booking, profile)
2. **Repository Setup** – Initialize GitHub repository with proper folder structure, branch strategy, and version control practices.
3. **Authentication Flow** – Implement login, registration, and error handling with secure API calls.
4. **API Integration** – Connect app with Laravel backend API, handle JSON responses, and manage state efficiently.
5. **Core Features Development** – Implement at least 3 main features: car browsing, booking, and profile management.
6. **Offline Capability** – Integrate local storage (SQLite or Hive) for caching key data.
7. **Push Notifications** – Implement Firebase/OneSignal for sending alerts and updates.
8. **Testing & Optimization** – Unit tests for authentication and booking flows; optimize performance for smooth navigation.

## Expected Outcomes

- A **fully functional cross-platform car rental mobile app** integrated with backend APIs.
- Hands-on experience in **UI/UX design, mobile frameworks, API integration, and state management**.
- Real-world deliverables including a **GitHub repository, working prototype, and documentation**.
